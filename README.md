# Chrome-Extension
I created a note taking extension that will allow you to take small notes and delete them when the use is done.

<strong>Step 1 </strong>Click on the 'snip and clip' button

<strong>Step 2 </strong>Click on the "+" button

<strong>Step 3 </strong>Enter the information you need for later use

<strong>Step 4 </strong>Delete it when your use of the note is done
